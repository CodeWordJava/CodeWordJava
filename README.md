### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<!---There are many reasons why I was inspired to make the leap into the tech sector. Aside from really enjoying both the creative and technical aspects of coding, I love working in a fast pace, innovative environment and being part of a team where there are opportunities to constantly grow and learn. Technology inspires and drives the way the world functions and lives, and I want to play my part in shaping its future development âœ¨--->

I'm Katie, a Junior software engineer based in Hampshire with a passion for debugging and problem solving.

After fantastic 10 years of working in Operations Management I am ready for a new challenge and The School of Code is my "yellow brick road" into the land of Tech!

I am super passionate about using my skills to improve peoples lives and would love to hear from anyone who has a role or an open source project that makes a difference to lives!

If Iâ€™m not sitting at my computer I will either be at the gym training for my next powerlifting competition or somewhere cozy with a good book and some even better coffee
