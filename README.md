### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Katie, a Junior software engineer based in Hampshire with a passion for creative problem solving.

After a a fantatsic 10 years of working in Operations Management I am ready for a new challenge and The School of Code is my "yelllow brick road" into the land of Tech!

<!---There are many reasons why I was inspired to make the leap into the tech sector. Aside from really enjoying both the creative and technical aspects of coding, I love working in a fast pace, innovative environment and being part of a team where there are opportunities to constantly grow and learn. Technology inspires and drives the way the world functions and lives, and I want to play my part in shaping its future development âœ¨

I graduated from the School of Code (a 16 week, full-time, fully-immersive programming bootcamp) in January 2021 and landed my first job as a junior sofwate engineer at Wise in mid-February. Since then, I've been working mainly on the backend with node.js, GraphQL and more recently GoLang, building and scaling microservices using Apollo Federation.--->

I am really passionate about using my skills to improve peoples lives and would love to hear from anyone who has an open source project that makes a difference!

If Iâ€™m not sitting at my computer I will either be at the gym training for my next competition or sonewhere cosy with a good book and some better coffee
